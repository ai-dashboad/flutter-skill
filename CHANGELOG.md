## 0.9.37

**Ships seven fixes that were merged months ago but never released, plus npm packaging and release-pipeline repairs**

The v0.9.24 and v0.9.36 tags were cut from commits that are not on `main`, so
everything merged since v0.9.35 stayed unreleased. This version delivers it all.

### Changes

**Previously merged but never shipped**
- Fix MCP server startup crash on macOS: the vendored npm entrypoint imported a
  package name its own pubspec did not declare, so the Dart fallback could not
  compile (#46, #51)
- Fall back to the Dart runtime when the native binary fails to spawn
  (`ENOEXEC`, `Unknown system error -8`) instead of crashing (#49, #55)
- Prefer the topmost route when resolving `tap`/`enter_text` by text or key, so
  a pushed screen is no longer bypassed for an identical label on the screen
  behind it (#53)
- `hot_reload` / `hot_restart` now drive Flutter Tools' reloadSources and
  hotRestart services, so code changes actually apply (#58)
- Reliable synthetic input engine: single activation, correct timestamps, drag
  hold, screenshot geometry, hittable flag (#59)
- `press_key` passes modifiers through the server, and emits no character while
  a modifier is held
- Fixes across routes, hardware keys, focus/type_text/set_checkbox/hover, lazy
  `scroll_to`, scroll direction and batch settle
- Add a named server registry and a `--server` flag for CLI commands (#38)

**Server robustness**
- A malformed JSON-RPC frame no longer ends the session. Invalid UTF-8 raised a
  stream-level error that terminated the process, and parse errors were dropped
  silently because they carried a null id (#54)

**npm package**
- The vendored Dart sources had been frozen at v0.9.1 while `lib/` grew to 100
  files, so the fallback ran a v0.2.0 server. They are now regenerated on every
  publish, which restores `tap` by `ref` and by coordinates (#52)
- The Dart fallback now works on Windows, names the Flutter SDK as the missing
  prerequisite instead of failing with an unrelated import error, and reports
  why `flutter pub get` failed instead of swallowing it (#45, #49, #50)
- A failed binary download no longer leaves an empty file behind that made every
  later install skip the download

**Release tooling**
- `release.sh` verifies the release is cut from `origin/main` and pushes
  atomically, so a tag can no longer land on a commit that is not on the branch
- `release.sh` refuses to publish the `TODO` CHANGELOG placeholder, which ten
  previous releases shipped as their entire changelog
- `release.sh` is now the only release entrypoint; three scripts that bypassed
  it were removed

---

## 0.9.21

**Auto-accept Chrome 146 remote debugging consent dialog**

### Changes
- Chrome 146 consent port shows "Allow remote debugging?" dialog on every connection — user had to manually click Allow each time
- Now auto-clicks the Allow button via macOS Accessibility API (AXSheet + AXButton description="Allow") in parallel with the WebSocket connection
- Users no longer need to manually confirm remote debugging — connect_cdp works seamlessly

---

## 0.9.20

**Respect launch_chrome:false — skip session-copy when user Chrome has no debug port**

### Changes
- When launch_chrome:false, Chrome is running but has no debug port: now fails with a clear error instead of launching a session-copy Chrome
- Previously Steps 2&3 (enable via chrome://inspect and restart with debug port) ran even with launch_chrome:false, overriding user intent
- Now Steps 2&3 only run when launch_chrome:true; false means "use existing debug port only"

---

- Users can now connect to their real Chrome browser without any session-copy workaround

---

## 0.9.10

**UX fixes: fill tool, press_key iOS fallback, go_back count, coordinate hint**

### Bug Fixes
- **`fill` tool registered**: `fill` was documented but threw `Unknown tool: fill`. Now maps to `enter_text` (clear + set value). Closes user-reported issue.
- **`press_key` on iOS/Android**: Added NativeDriver fallback so `press_key` works in Flutter VM Service mode on simulators/emulators (previously returned unsupported error). Enter key now triggers iOS search without needing CDP mode.
- **`enter_text` without key**: When called without `key`/`ref`, returns an actionable `hint` field pointing to `inspect_interactive()` instead of the confusing `No TextField matching key 'null' found` error.
- **`go_back` with `count`**: Accepts a `count` parameter to pop multiple routes in one call with 300 ms pauses between steps — replaces repeated `go_back()` chains.
- **`native_screenshot` coordinate hint**: Response now includes `scale_factor` and a `coordinate_hint` field that explains the physical→logical pixel conversion, eliminating manual coordinate guessing.

---

## 0.9.9

**C++ desktop automation SDK**

### New SDK
- **C++ Bridge SDK** (`sdks/cpp/`): Cross-platform native C++ automation bridge. Embeds a zero-dependency WebSocket server (RFC 6455) + JSON-RPC 2.0 dispatcher in your C++ app so AI agents can control it via the flutter-skill protocol. Closes #22.
  - **macOS**: CGEvent for input synthesis, `screencapture` for screenshots, AXUIElement for accessibility inspection
  - **Windows**: `SendInput` + GDI+ (screenshots) + `GetForegroundWindow`
  - **Linux**: XTest extension + XGetImage/libpng + EWMH
  - No external dependencies — SHA-1, base64, and WebSocket framing are bundled
  - Full CMake build system (`CMakeLists.txt`) for all three platforms
- **Tests**: 30 unit tests (JSON-RPC, SHA-1/base64/WebSocket RFC vectors, bridge protocol with mock backend) + 27 real integration tests verified live on macOS (1630 KB PNG screenshot, tap, scroll, all key names, enter_text, inspect, window title)

---

## 0.9.8

**Multi-flavor app detection, fresh-install UX, Docker/Snap build fixes, CI smoke tests**

### Bug Fixes
- **Multi-flavor app detection** (#24): `scan_and_connect` now accepts `flavor` and `device_id` parameters. When multiple flavors run simultaneously, flutter-skill picks the correct instance instead of connecting randomly.
- **Fresh-install plugins warning** (#23): Removed the `Plugins directory not found` warning on clean installs — silently skipped instead.
- **Docker build**: Dockerfile now uses `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable` so `flutter pub get` resolves Flutter SDK dependencies correctly.
- **Snap build**: Added `git config --global --add safe.directory /opt/flutter` to resolve `detected dubious ownership` error in snapcraft builds.

### CI / Testing
- Smoke test job added to CI: verifies fresh `flutter pub global activate` install works end-to-end.
- Post-release smoke test in release workflow: installs from pub.dev and npm after publish and confirms server responds.

---

## 0.9.7

**press_key for Flutter VM Service, pytest plugin, HarmonyOS SDK, CI smoke tests**

### Bug Fixes
- **press_key in Flutter mode**: `press_key` now works when connected via VM Service (not just CDP/bridge). Calls the existing `ext.flutter.flutter_skill.pressKey` extension that was already registered in the target app but never wired from the CLI side. Fixes #21.

### New SDKs
- **pytest-flutter-skill** (`sdks/python/`): pytest plugin for AI-driven Flutter/web app automation. Provides a `flutter_skill` fixture that starts the MCP server and wraps all tools as Python methods with native pytest assertions (`assert_visible`, `assert_text`, `assert_not_visible`, `find_element`). Closes #14.
- **HarmonyOS SDK** (`sdks/harmonyos/`): ArkTS bridge SDK (`FlutterSkillAbility.ets`) for HarmonyOS apps. Implements screenshot, tap, enter_text, press_key, scroll, go_back, get_current_route, inspect, get_logs over WebSocket on port 18118. Closes #13.

### CI / Testing
- **Smoke test job** added to CI: simulates a new user installing from local source via `dart pub global activate`, then verifies `--version`, MCP `initialize`, and `tools/list` work correctly.
- **Post-release smoke test** added to release workflow: installs from pub.dev and npm after each release (with retry for CDN propagation) and verifies the published package serves JSON-RPC correctly.

---

## 0.9.6

**Shadow DOM deep pierce for tap/snapshot, serve port reuse fix**

### Changes
- `tap` text search now uses `_dqAll('*')` instead of a hardcoded tag list, so custom elements like Reddit's `faceplate-button` are found by text match
- Snapshot second pass collects `button/[role=button]/[type=submit]` elements nested inside shadow roots
- `serve` binds with `shared: true` (SO_REUSEADDR) to avoid TIME_WAIT "Address already in use" crashes on restart

---

## 0.9.1

**CLI client commands, GitHub Pages docs, comprehensive platform guide**

### New Features
- **CLI client commands for serve API**: `nav`, `snap`, `screenshot`, `tap`, `type`, `key`, `eval`, `title`, `text`, `hover`, `upload`, `tools`, `call`, `wait`
- **GitHub Pages documentation site**: Static docs site at `docs/site/` with auto-deploy workflow

### Documentation
- Comprehensive IDE/platform integration guide with all supported AI platforms
- CLI client reference (`docs/CLI_CLIENT.md`) with scripting examples and CI/CD patterns
- Updated IDE setup guide with OpenClaw serve mode and Continue.dev sections

### Bug Fixes
- **Chrome WebSocket 403 Forbidden**: Fixed Origin header handling
- **Domain-based tab matching**: Never hijack unrelated tabs
- **PUT for /json/new**: Chrome 145+ requires PUT instead of GET

---

## 0.9.0

**iOS native automation + React Native support + bridge reliability**

### New Features
- **6 native P0 tools**: `native_long_press`, `native_gesture`, `native_press_key`, `native_key_combo`, `native_button`, `native_list_simulators`
- **Video recording**: `native_video_start` / `native_video_stop` — H.264 MP4 via simctl recordVideo
- **Frame capture**: `native_capture_frames` — burst JPEG at configurable FPS
- **Hardware buttons**: `apple_pay` and `side` button support via HID injection
- **fs-ios-bridge**: Native ObjC HID injector (74KB) using SimulatorKit private APIs — ~1ms latency vs ~1s for osascript
- **React Native iOS**: Full bridge + native tool support verified (41/42 pass)

### Bug Fixes
- **Bridge mode null safety**: drag coordinate support, edge_swipe defaults, assert_text nullable key
- **execute_batch**: accepts both `actions` and `commands` param names
- **native_gesture/key_combo**: flexible param types (List and String)
- **get_widget_properties**: improved error message for missing key
- **get_text_value**: nullable key support

### Test Results
| Platform | Pass | Total | Rate |
|----------|------|-------|------|
| Web CDP | 128 | 128 | 100% |
| iOS Native | 28 | 29 | 97% |
| iOS Multi-App | 62 | 62 | 100% |
| iOS Cross-Stack | 28 | 28 | 100% |
| iOS Bridge (Flutter) | 62 | 62 | 100% |
| React Native iOS | 41 | 42 | 98% |

### Stats
- **253** MCP tool definitions / **176** in tool registry
- **10** platforms supported
- **fs-ios-bridge**: tap, long-press, swipe, key, button, gesture, screenshot, key-combo, text, list

## 0.8.9

**Heavy DOM site stability + CI fixes**

### Bug Fixes
- **get_network_requests**: Limited to 100 entries (configurable via `limit` param) — prevents OOM/hang on heavy DOM sites (YouTube, Amazon, Reddit)
- **dart analyze**: Resolved all 8 warnings (unused vars, unnecessary null assertions)
- **dart format**: Formatted all 41 files

### Performance Verified — Heavy DOM Sites
| Site | Tools | Time | Snapshot |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| YouTube | 15/15 ✅ | 6.9s | 43ms |
| Amazon | 15/15 ✅ | 14.2s | 1ms |
| Reddit | 15/15 ✅ | 17.9s | 6ms |
| HN | 15/15 ✅ | 4.8s | 53ms |
| Wikipedia | 15/15 ✅ | 7.8s | 15ms |

## 0.8.8

**CDP reliability + multi-platform fixes**

### Bug Fixes
- **swipe/drag/gesture**: Single 10s overall timeout instead of per-event (prevents cascading CDP failures)
- **connect_cdp**: URL now optional — port-only connections for Electron, Android, external browsers
- **Region screenshots**: JPEG@80 with 10s timeout + fallback to full screenshot
- **switch_tab/close_tab**: Support `index` param (AI agents pass index, not target_id)
- **diff_baseline_create**: Added `max_pages` param (default 10) to prevent unbounded crawling
- **CDP JSON serialization**: All JS returns use `JSON.stringify()` → `jsonDecode()` for reliable object handling

### Refactoring
- Extracted `_jsResolveElement()` and `_parseJsonEval()` helpers — eliminated hardcoded selector patterns
- Net -75 lines in CDP driver

### Test Results
| Platform | Pass | Fail | Skip |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Web CDP | 140 | 2 | 23 |
| Electron | 139 | 0 | 26 |
| Flutter Web | 139 | 0 | 26 |
| Android | 134 | 5 | 26 |

**Release script fix and cleanup**

### Fixes
- Fixed release script adding duplicate CHANGELOG entries when version entry already exists
- Cleaned up CHANGELOG formatting

---

## 0.7.2

**Fix type cast errors in get_errors and get_network_requests**

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `get_errors` crashing with `type 'String' is not a subtype of type 'int?'` when passing limit/offset parameters
- Fixed `get_network_requests` with same type cast issue for limit parameter
- Used safe `int.tryParse` pattern instead of direct `as int?` cast for JSON-RPC params

---

## 0.7.1

**Bug fixes, screenshot reliability, and new features**

### Bug Fixes
- **Screenshot after navigation**: Fixed stale screenshot showing old page after `Navigator.push()`. Now captures from the RenderView layer instead of first RepaintBoundary, correctly rendering the current visible page
- **enter_text without key**: Can now enter text into the currently focused TextField without providing a widget key. Tap a field first, then call `enter_text(text: "...")`
- **assert_text on buttons**: `assert_text` now reads child Text widgets from buttons, labels, and other non-TextField elements
- **Session auto-switch**: `connect_app`, `launch_app`, and `scan_and_connect` now always switch the active session to the newly connected app
- **screenshot_region**: Added `save_to_file` support (saves to temp file like regular screenshot)
- **get_errors pagination**: Added `limit` and `offset` parameters to prevent massive responses
- **inspect page filter**: Added `current_page_only` parameter to filter out elements from old Navigator routes

### New Features
- **Network monitoring**: 3 new MCP tools (`enable_network_monitoring`, `get_network_requests`, `clear_network_requests`) for tracking HTTP traffic via VM Service profiling
- **README rewrite**: Clearer positioning as an AI-powered E2E testing tool with better examples and discoverability

### Region Screenshot
- `screenshot_region` now reuses the same RenderView layer capture, fixing the same stale-page issue as regular screenshots

---

## 0.7.0
